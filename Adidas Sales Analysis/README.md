# Adidas Sales Performance Analysis with SQL

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Adidas sales dataset using MySQL. The primary objective was to perform data cleaning,
conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and derive actionable insights into sales performance, profitability, and market trends. By leveraging 
advanced SQL functions, I transformed raw transactional data into a structured format to answer key business questions.

## Key Skills & Tools Used

- Data Cleaning & Transformation: (String manipulation, STR_TO_DATE, Data Type Casting)
 
- Advanced SQL: (Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions like DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() and LAG())
  
- Data Aggregation Functions Like GROUP BY, SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT()
  
- Analytical Techniques: (Time-Series Analysis, Profitability Analysis, Customer Segmentation)

## Analytical Questions & Key Findings

### 1. What are the top-performing products and regions?

```sql
SELECT Region,Product,
		ROUND(SUM(`Total Amount`)) AS Total_Amount,
        ROUND(SUM(Profit)) AS Profit,
ROW_NUMBER() 
	OVER(
		PARTITION BY Region 
        ORDER BY SUM(`Total Amount`) DESC,SUM(Profit) DESC
        ) AS `Rank`
FROM adidas
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

ㅤ

Used ROW_NUMBER() to rank products and regions by total sales and profit, identifying which product lines 
and geographical areas are the most significant revenue drivers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Calculate the aggregate Total Amount and Profit for each Retailer ID and categorize them into performance tiers based on their profitability.

```sql
WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT `Retailer ID`,
		ROUND(SUM(`Total Amount`)) AS Total_Amount,
        ROUND(SUM(Profit)) AS Profit
FROM adidas
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT *,
CASE
	WHEN Profit >= (SELECT AVG(Profit) FROM CTE) * 1.33 THEN 'High-Value'
    WHEN Profit <= (SELECT AVG(Profit) FROM CTE) * 0.66 THEN 'Low-Value'
	ELSE 'Medium-Value'
END AS Retail_Segmentation
FROM CTE;
```

SELECT Region,Product,CONCAT(ROUND(AVG(`Profit in Percentage`),2),'%') AS avg_profit_margin 
FROM adidas
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

### 4. What's the year-over-year percentage change in total sales and profit for each region to assess growth and performance trends.

```sql
SELECT Region,
	   year,
       ROUND(SUM(`Total Amount`)) AS Total_Amount,
	   CONCAT(ROUND(((ROUND(SUM(`Total Amount`)) - ROUND(LAG(SUM(`Total Amount`)) OVER(PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY year))) /
       ROUND(LAG(SUM(`Total Amount`)) OVER(PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY year))),2),'%') AS Total_Amount_year_over_year,
       CONCAT(ROUND(((ROUND(SUM(`Profit`)) - ROUND(LAG(SUM(`Profit`)) OVER(PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY year))) /
       ROUND(LAG(SUM(`Profit`)) OVER(PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY year))),2),'%') AS Profit_year_over_year
FROM adidas
GROUP BY 1,2
