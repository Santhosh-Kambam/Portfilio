# HR Dataset Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of an HR employee attrition dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn). The primary objective was to clean and transform the data, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract actionable business insights related to employee satisfaction, attrition, and workforce demographics. Advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques were leveraged to answer key HR questions and guide strategic recommendations.

## Key Skills & Tools Used

- Data Cleaning & Transformation: (String manipulation, mapping categorical codes to labels, dropping irrelevant columns)
- Data Analysis: (Pandas DataFrame operations, aggregation, grouping, value counts)
- Data Visualization: (Matplotlib, Seaborn for histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps)
- Analytical Techniques: (Attrition analysis, satisfaction level breakdowns, demographic segmentation, trend analysis)

## Analytical Questions & Key Findings

### 1. Average Age by Department: Understand the average age distribution of employees across different departments.

```python
avg_age_by_department = df.groupby('department')['age'].mean().round().reset_index()
avg_age_by_department
ax = sns.boxplot(data = df,x='department',y='age')
plt.title('Average Age distribution by Department')
plt.xlabel('Department')
plt.ylabel('Avg Age')
plt.tight_layout()
for i,dept in enumerate(avg_age_by_department['department'].sort_values(ascending=False).unique()):
    avg_age = avg_age_by_department[avg_age_by_department['department'] == dept]['age'].values[0]
    ax.text(i,avg_age,f'{avg_age:.1f}')
plt.show()
```

att_ratio

plt.pie(
    x=att_ratio['count'],
    labels = att_ratio['attrition'],
    shadow=True,
    autopct='%1.1f%%',
    colors = ["#938A22","#E2D588"]
)

## Key Findings & Insights

### Attrition & Workforce Analysis:
- The overall employee attrition rate is ~16%.
- Overtime work and lack of recent promotions are significant attrition drivers.
- Most employees report high satisfaction, but pockets of low work-life balance and job satisfaction exist.
- Executive and managerial roles have higher compensation; most employees earn below the mean.
- Strong correlations exist between income, job level, and total working years.

### Recommendations:
- Focus on improving work-life balance to reduce overtime-driven attrition.
- Consider targeted retention strategies for employees with long periods since last promotion.
- Monitor satisfaction metrics and prioritize interventions for at-risk employee segments.
